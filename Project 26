Step 1: Gather Your Kitchen Materials

- 1 large mixing bowl
- 1 small mixing bowl
-1 wisk
-1 electric mixer
-Baking Sheet
-Wire cooling rack
-Wax or parchment paper
-Non-Stick cooking spray
-1 tablespoon and teaspoon from a set
-1 cup
-¼ cup


Step 2: Gather Your Ingredients

-2 ¼ cups all purpose flour
-1 teaspoon baking soda
-1 teaspoon salt
-1 cup (2 sticks) of softened butter
-¾ cups granulated sugar
-¾ cups brown sugar (packed)
-1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-2 large eggs
-2 cups chocolate chips (either milk, dark, or semi-sweet)


Step 3: Preheat Your Oven to 350 Degrees Fahrenheit

Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients
In your smaller mixing bowl, combine your flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk it together and put it to the side.

Step 5: Mix Wet Ingredients
In your larger mixing bowl, beat together with your electric mixer the granulated sugar and your softened butter until it is creamy. Then, once your mixture is light and creamy, add in your brown sugar and vanilla. Beat it all together until everything is combined.

Step 6: Add Eggs
Add in the eggs one at a time to the butter, sugar, and vanilla mixture after it is all incorporated. Beat the mixture after each egg addition. Beat the mixture again once both eggs are mixed in. Beat this mixture until it is creamy.

Step 7: Combine Flour Mixture to Butter Mixture
Gradually beat in the flour mixture by 1/4 cup to the wet ingredients mixture. Every time you add a section of the flour mixture make sure you beat it fully into the butter mixture. Use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to wipe down the sides of the bowl. Repeat this until all of your flour mixture is fully incorporated.

Step 8: Add Chocolate Chips
Stir in the chocolate chips to your cookie dough.

Step 9: Cover Your Pan
Once your dough is all mixed together, grab your baking sheet. You can either use a cooking spray or wax or parchment paper. If you use wax or parchment paper, get a piece and cover the bottom of your tray with it. If you are using cooking spray, just spray the bottom of your pan.

Step 10: Scoop Your Cookies!
Drop the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet by the tablespoon or 1/4 cup. Make sure they are at least 2-3 inches apart so that they do not merge together while baking.

Step 11: Bake Your Cookies
Cook the cookies for 9 to 11 minutes, or until golden brown. When the cookies are done take them out of the oven, off the tray and transfer them to the wire rack. Start your next batch with the leftover dough.

Enjoy!
